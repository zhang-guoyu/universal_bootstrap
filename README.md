# universal_bootstrap

Codes for simulation and real data in the paper "*Covariance test and universal bootstrap by operator norm*", by Guoyu Zhang, Dandan Jiang, and Fang Yao.

**function.R** includes the main function for the proposed proposed universal bootstrap for the operator norm-based statistics $T$ (Opn), the combined statistics $T^{\text{Com}}$ (Com), 
togather with the operator norm-based statistic $T^{\text{Roy}}$ (Roy), the Frobenius norm-based linear spectral statistic $T^{\text{F},1}$ (Lfn),
 the debiased Frobenius norm-based U statistic $T^{\text{F},2}$ (Ufn), and the supremum norm-based statistic $T^{\text{sup}}$ (Supn).
